# Global Flight Data Visualizer

**Real-time 3D flight tracking application built in Unity**

---

## Overview

This project visualizes live aircraft positions on a 3D globe using data from the [OpenSky Network API](https://opensky-network.org/). It demonstrates real-time telemetry integration, interactive visualization, and software engineering best practices in Unity and C#.

---

## Features

- Real-time flight tracking with live latitude, longitude, altitude, and velocity data.
- 3D globe with dynamic plane visualization using low-overhead 2D sprites.
- Smooth interpolation of plane movement for realistic motion.
- Interactive flight search with plane highlighting and flight info HUD.
- Modular C# architecture with separate scripts for telemetry fetching, visualization, and UI.
- Performance optimizations for handling hundreds of simultaneous flights.
